## Finding Lane Lines on the Road

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of the following steps:
1. Convert an image to grayscale using custom conversion (grayscale)
2. Apply gaussian blur filter on grayscale image (blur)
3. Invoke Canny edge detection algorithm (canny)
4. Apply region of interest filter (roi)
5. Apply Hough transformation (hough)
6. Evaluate lanes borders (hough analysis)
7. Feed lanes to /averager/ (averager)
8. Draw proposed by /averager/ lanes on the image (draw)

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to ...
